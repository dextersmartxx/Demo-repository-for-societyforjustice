        She's a 23 years old mother of four, heavily pregnant with what will be the fifth. But Mrs. Glory Edem Archibong is not relishing the joy of pregnancy right now, for her problems seem to protrude in all directions beyond her tummy.
        Glory is one of hundreds of thousand that returned to the Nigeria mainland, following the ceding of the Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon purportedly under the terms of the Green Tree agreement in 2006 following the International Court of Justice judgment of 2002. Her husband, Edem, was, upon arrival to the housing estate, engaged as a security man but has not received any pay in the last 3 months. They were among numerous others that came from Abana, one of Bakassi’s main towns. Like most Bakassians, Edem had been a fisherman and had had no difficulties raising his children from the proceeds of the fishing business,
      </p>

      <p>
        but forced out of his natural, river-rine  fishing environment into the dry land of Ikang housing settlement in the so-called New Bakassi, Edem had fared like a fish out of water literally. He had tried to get a job – any sort of job – to enable him fend for his family, but the first job he did upon leaving Abana was an unenviable one: burying his 2-and-a-half year old daughter, Victoria, who died in their makeshift camp. She’d taken ill  soon upon their arrival at the  primary school premises where they’d been taken upon arrival from Abana, along with other refugees.
        Both Edem and his wife Glory believe that if there had been primary health care facilities close to that camp, their daughter would be alive today
        That episode, far more than the actual departure from their ancestral land in Abana, sowed the seed of bitterness, a bitterness that deepens with each new chapter in their new experience: the unpaid salary as each month drags past, the boasting of government officials that they’d done well in resetting returnees, the deteriorating environment, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        We actually met Glory trying to feed the remaining children, that feeding consisted of both giving them some local food and comforting them over the poor quality/quantity of such food. Three of the kids – Mary 6 years Edet, 4 years and Augustine 1  year, should have been in school at the time we met them but of course, they were not, having been withdrawn for lack of school fees.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Archibongs were the solitary residents of the entire housing estate built with UN and federal Assistance and commissioned with fanfare by the Cross River State government. The entire estate was bare (Unfenced). Even the block by the entrance marked Police Post had as its residents lizards and rodents who have effectively become the Archibong’s neighbours. Asked why they were alone in the housing estate the Archibong’s informed us that on the day of the commissioning in February 2009, there had been many residents. Some have since left, some lucky ones to squat with their relatives or friends in Akwabutong (See related story), some to Calabar to pursue menial jobs and sweep the streets, while others went back to Abana (i.e. to Cameroon to become Cameroonians). Glory and Edem say they had actually contemplated going back to Abana but thoughts of the torture at the hands of the gendarmes is what has so far kept them from moving. However, if the misery, the poverty and the sense of loss of identity intensifies as seems much the case, then the Archibongs may yet take the dreadful steps back to Bakassi to await their fate at the hands of the gendarmes.

        At first glance, 19 year old Mercy Victor Awani comes across as a charming damsel. Until you get closer. Then you realize that all that  cheerleader’s cheerfulness is only a decoy, albeit a life-saving one; that all that laughter is only a rafter, a lifejacket she clings onto to survive  the turbulent waters. Mercy is one of numerous youngsters who fled Bakassi with their families - or what was left of them -  in the aftermath of the gendarme atrocities and wars and the consequent relocation. She lives with her mother Eno, younger sister Esther, a male cousin, 33, and two younger siblings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Esther herself has in the last twelve months given birth to a baby, the result of prevalent adolescent pregnancy wave, from boys who are neither equipped nor willing to take care of the babies but who simply cashed in on the  availability of  girls rendered cheap and ready-to-take by the force of circumstance, These days, Mercy does not go to school. She had dropped out in Senior Secondary School (SS3) from the Mary  Anne School in Bakassi.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had had dreams of being an engineer, but three years out of school, harsh realities at Ibaka the waterfront settlement where she lives with the rest of her family has made her bury her engineering dreams. She now  supports her family income by smoking fish for  fish traders. Her father’s death  before the relocation to Ibaka was the aftermath of his building being destroyed by the gendarmes. His  cousin who now ferries commuters across the waters for a fee of about N300/day (see main story) can hardly meet his own needs let alone think of encouraging Mercy to resume her schooling.(He is yet to be married at 33 although he had been doing a boutique business that brought in a fair income way back in Abana, Bakassi). Mercy herself has now accepted her fate.  All the high grades in  Integrated Science, all the prospects that Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics offered have now gone up in fish-smoke.

        It only needs to be noted that the returnees in question are not here of their own free will; those who came before the August 14 2006 ceding were compelled to flee on pain of death, as their own country, Nigeria, rather abandoned them to their fate; that when they  fled, they left  all their belongings behind;
      </p>

      <p>
        that those who came after the ceding did so on the back of a promise that they would be fully resettled. " Each time I discuss this Bakassi  matter, it hurts so deeply; it pains my heart", said  Effiong Edet Effiong, one-time Secretary of Bakassi Local Government.  He didn't have to say that, for each word of his was practically squeezed out of pain and anguish.  "That man that called himself our former head of State is not a man of honor", he said, referring to Gen Olusegun Obasanjo. Effiong who is now one of the plaintiffs in two different cases instituted against the federal government of Nigeria, informed that immediately after the ICJ judgment in 2002, they (Bakassi patriots and opinion leaders) drew up an action plan which they were going to put into effect to ensure that they remained in their ancestral homeland in Nigeria. However, they also formed several delegations that visited Obasanjo, as Head of State,  to intimate him of their resolve to remain in Nigeria.  " He (Obasanjo) knelt down in Aso Villa (Nigerian President's official residence) before village heads, clan heads, paramount rulers and  leaders of opinion from Bakassi,  assuring us that not one inch of our land would go to Cameroon. He assured us repeatedly each time our delegation called on him. We believed him, but he betrayed us". The view is held by other Bakassians who were privy to the Action plans. "Yes, he betrayed us. He tied our hands", lamented another Bakassi elite, holed up in Calabar and battling to find a school for his children.
      </p>

      <p>
        The experience has served to bring out the sainthood of otherwise damnable dictator Sani Abacha. "The man we will forever remember", said Effiong, "is the late General Sani Abacha who, he said, " gave us hope, (and) a  sense of belonging. He recognized our plight and   made  us secure".
        Another traitor, said Effiong, is former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Bola Ajibola who, after writing a minority judgment in favor of Nigeria at the world court, turned around to be at the forefront of the implementation team of the Green Tree Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        But even as a piece of betrayal of the hopes of Bakassi and indeed, Nigeria, the Green Tree Agreement had some redeeming features, as noted earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact Annex 1 (4) of the Agreement provides for a 5-year transitional period which requires Cameroon to, among other things,  facilitate the exercise of the rights  of Nigerian nationals living in the zone and access by Nigerian civil authorities to the Nigerian population living in the zone.
      </p>

      <p>
        These rights have been observed more in their breach, according to the returnees. The Green Tree Agreement was signed on 12 June 2006 and barely two months after, on 14 August 2006, the villages in the northern part of the peninsula - Archibong, Akwa Town, Amato, Efut-Inwang and other important towns were handed over to Cameroon in a ceremony in Archibong  in the Presence of  then Attorney General Bayo Ojo who represented President Yar'Adua, the Inspector-General of Police, the D-G National Boundary Commission, and Donald Duke, then Governor of Cross River State.
        When northern Bakassi towns were being handed over, the Nigerian authorities sought to placate Bakassians and other Nigerians,  assuring them that Nigeria was bound to obey the ICJ ruling as a law abiding nation, and that when the northern towns were handed over, residents from those northern towns would be expected to relocate to the southern axis. i.e. Abana, Atabong, etc for 5 years within which period they would be able to sort out their lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact the Obasanjo assured them that the process would be painless and that they would respect the people's land and ancestral rights. But two years after, the whole of Bakassi was handed over by the rule-of-law-touting Yar'Adua administration, even in the face of an Abuja high court injunction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today the flag of Cameroon flies over Bakassi. While a huge number of Bakassians have remained to battle it out with the gendarmes, those who fled or were  sweet-talked to leave or opted to relocate to the mainland for tactical reasons have turned more or  less refugees in their own country. Now Anger stalks Ikang where the majority of them can be found. Anger at their economic privations, anger at political gerrymandering by the cross River state government which by the Akwabuyo and Bakassi Local Government Areas Boundary (adjustment) Law, No. 7 of  2007, crated the so-called New Bakassi Local Government. It did this by simply, theoretically dividing the Ikangs of Akwabuyo into two entities calling one half "New Bakassi" while the other retained Akwabuyo. But the people of Ikang are said to be resentful of the whole exercise, especially the superimposing of names from Bakassi on the Ikang wards. "It's all for the purpose of making a show of conducting elections, say Bakassians. It has nothing to do with resettling us. Right now, said one of them, "Bakassi Local Government exists in the air".
        Indeed, but not from the point of view of nominating candidates and wards for elections and of  receiving federal allocations. Regarding the latter, the 1999 Nigerian constitution recognizes 774 local governments of which Bakassi, with Headquarters in Abana, is one. Also CRS retains its oil producing status only if Bakassi remains with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get its hands on the monies ( which someone has called blood money), the CRS came up with the contrivance called New Bakassi. But now that the various suits filed against their balkanization seem to be having at least some of the desired results, CRS has, for starters, lost its  oil producing status. And neighboring Akwa Ibom ( with whom she contested ownership of several towns in Bakassi) is not weeping for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what really do the Bakassians want? Resettlement in a location known as  Dayspring Island which is contiguous to Bakassi, has similar geographic and climatic features (suitable for fishing etc) with it, and the relocation to which will not pose the kind of problems associated with the move to Ikang in Akwabuyo. The state and federal governments have so far pooh-poohed the idea, but the Bakassians are fighting on, especially with the realization that they hold the key to oil-producing and, ultimately, economic wellbeing of the state dubbed  "the Peoples paradise".
      </p>

      <p>
         Right now political complications have come into the picture with splinter group from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) and the Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization (SCAPO) showing more than passing interest. So many things  that can work in their favour are happening on various fronts; soon their  subjugators will be handicapped. The people of Bakassi may yet have their Dayspring. It is a matter of time.

        Nothing prepares you for the misery that awaits you as you prepare to make your breath-taking descent (from okada motor bike, that is) through erosion-ravaged, steeply sloped pathways into Akwabutong, Cross River State, the creek-surrounded village on the south eastern tip of Nigeria, (shorn of its aquatic marine and other land resources now controversially  ceded to Cameroon). The luxuriance of green palms and other beautiful shrubbery that ushered you through Calabar and Akwabuyo actually belied the discontentment that visited the visitor to Akwabutong, now 'home' to a groups of returnees from Abana, Atabong, Archibong and several other towns and villages that constituted the Bakassi Peninsula and formed part of Nigeria prior to the  August 2006  handover, purportedly in line with the October 2002 ICJ verdict. Edet Okon Akpai Nkanya, leader of the returnees informed the International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights (ISSJHR) that as a group, they rejected the housing estate blocks allocated to them. "All my life I have been a fisherman, how do I begin to learn a completely alien life at my old age?", he queried.  It was a view echoed by virtually all the other returnees: youths in their teens inclusive. But there were  problems of a more practical nature behind their rejection of the 'houses' (see below).  The women seemed to fare better. They showed off their catch of periwinkles picked from adjoining lagoons and swamps. It was very much the sort of vocation they were into back at Abana, only then they had a much wider waterfront to explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the returnees had already merged with the Akwabutong indigenes and would rather not dwell on their current predicament. "We are like Israelites on their way out of Egypt" said one old man, "in front is the mighty Red Sea and behind the strokes of the Egyptians awaited our already bleeding backs". Their children, aged  somewhere between one and half to 1twelve/thirteen years massed behind bags of relief materials, some with their nylon bags and kom-kom containers. It reminded you of  scenes from the Nigerian Civil war. By our estimates, three quarters of them did not go to school that day; not that school in itself was particularly pleasant, not when they had to trek some ten kilometers through  rough and steep terrains to the nearest one at Ekpri Ikang; not when such a trek would mostly be on empty or near-empty stomach, not when constant harassment awaited them for not paying the school fees. The women joined the children and their menfolk, practically salivating over a few bags of rice, garri groundnut oil and salt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet this was a people of a proud heritage. The land of the valiant. The story was told of one Efiong (whose son is still alive and is one of those at the forefront of  the struggle for justice for the Bakassians) who bare-handedly battled and vanquished an armed Cameroonian gendarme. It was also the land of the prosperous; traders who lived comfortably off their God-given natural aquatic endowments.  In fact, other Nigerians  who have either been complicit or are now playing the ostrich are already feeling the pain of that handover, for Bakassi peninsula is an area habited by a unique shoals of fishes including crayfish. It is estimated that more than  75 per cent of the crayfish consumed in Cross River and neighboring Akwa Ibom, Abia, Imo, Rivers and many other Eastern states comes from the area. A bag of that commodity that cost about N12,000 when Bakassi was in Nigeria now costs about N47,000, and so many people in those states now do without the delicacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Abana, or Atabong or any of the Bakassi settlements, a youth with his fishing boat could easily fish out (no pun intended) N5million for one investment or the other, from his business, but now they are practically scrounging for what can only provide for a bare existence. Even those who were not in the fishing trade had been doing well for themselves  while in Bakassi. Bassey Edet Awani left Abana with his family in 2005, a year before northern Bakassi (consisting of Archibong, Amoto, etc) was ceded. He was fleeing constant gendarme harassment. He had owned a boutique and was raking in more than N1,500 profit per day (about N2,000 day in today's money). Today he begs boat owners to ferry passengers across from Ibaka to Abana and other shores, for about  N300 per day, an amount that can hardly go beyond the cost of a plate of food in a local buka. It is the same tale of privation wherever they have been scattered; a large concentration is in Ikang which has, for that purpose been divided into two with one half  being dubbed  'New Bakassi' from where many found their way to Calabar the Cross River State capital. That move is, however, rejected by most returnees and locals (see below). Other settlements with sizeable numbers include: Ibaka, Ibot Ikot and Ewang all in Mbo Local Government, as well as Okobo and  Oron  all in Akwa Ibom State.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the difficulty of taking in entire families, many returnees have had to split themselves, in a few cases, with father, mother and (sets of) children staying apart where the situation could not be helped.  The result has been a redrawing of the social and moral map of the people. With so many school age children out of school  due to parents' inability to pay school fees, and with many of the socially-induced dropouts unable to obtain  decent accommodation, teenage pregnancies and abortions have multiplied. In Ibaka, 16 year old Esther fondly cuddles her ten-month baby boy, in the same roof with her mummy and daddy and gazes intently like the beggar at the Beautiful Gate in the  Acts of the Apostles, at any visitor to their make-shift abode.
      </p>

      <p>
        She'd ended her schooling in primary Two, far too far from the educational threshold of the nursing profession she had wanted to pursue when she still nursed her dreams way back in Bakassi. But her case is a lot better than that of another teenager, a 18 year old also named Esther.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a tender age, Esther 2 had been shot in the leg by gendarmes while trying to flee with her parents from Abana. It didn't seem irredeemably fatal at the time; perhaps a routine operation could easily have saved the young girl's leg, but none was performed until  decay and sepsis set in. Uneducated, physically incapacitated, emotionally and spiritually drained, Esther 2 soon got pregnant in circumstances that had more to do with rape and sado-masochism than consensual sex. Her poorly maintained  wooden 'leg' gave her no chance against any sex intruder. She was simply there for the taking. She  now worries less for herself and more for her 8month baby boy named Philip (see related story: Esther Eyeni and her Amputated Dreams); Esther 2  is now an open sore to Cross River State, to Nigeria, to Cameroon and her trigger-happy gendarmes and to the world that prefers to bury its head, ostrich-fashion, in cold complicity. Throughout the make-shift camps of the displaced Bakassians, in Ibot Ikot, Ibaka, Okobo, Ikang, Calabar etc, the story is the same: mangled bodies, silenced voices, wearied spirits and truncated dreams, except for a handful of newly radicalized elements who are changing the character of the struggle (see related story)
      </p>

      <p>
        The main housing scheme, much trumpeted as The Settlement for the returnees consisted of some 364 units of one-room apartments on the left side of the dilapidated (the word does not fully describe the sorry state of this road, especially beyond this point) road to Akwabutong, down on the mangrove coast of Bakassi mainland.
        The rest of the neighboring community across the Akwabutong River that speak the same language and share a common culture - Abana, Archibong, Atabong are now in Cameroon following the haphazard implementation of the contentious Green Tree Agreement by former Head of State Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Archibongs are stuck up in Block Six of the Housing Estate as the solitary occupants because they too, it seems, equally plan to leave some day. The husband is lucky to have been given a motor bike (locally dubbed okada)  with which he now conveys passengers  within the immediate communities. This brings in a measure of income which only meets the barest needs. They still buy water for drinking and other shores. The  overhead tank for the borehole that provides the estate with water is as dry as the harmattan wind; there is no electricity to pump the water.  Public power supply  from the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) being non-existent, the government authorities rightly decided to install an alternative power generator. That worked on the day of the commissioning, according to Glory, and has never worked again since then. Thus, water for drinking and domestic use is a major challenge for  surviving on the estate. It's all very strange for a people who all their lives, have practically lived on water. Contracts for the blocks were said to have been hurriedly given to 132 different contractors in one day, mostly cronies and agents of those in Authority.  Each house is  a block of four one-room apartments, two in front and the others  at the back. None is fenced, neither is there a perimeter fencing around the complex which is surrounded by overgrown bush. The surrounding bush has already merged with that which now almost obscures the houses from within. The environment is thus a natural habitat for reptiles, rodents and even animals of the wild.   Presented as a home for hitherto homeless people, the houses themselves might appear a piece of advertisement for a caring government, from an outsider's point of view, But the grim reality is that the houses are a study in stark social and cultural dislocation. Not just because even if you were a ten-member family you were given a one room flat (ie bedroom, kitchen and toilet), but because of  the absence of even the most critical amenity like water.

      <p>
        Through the ages, history is  replete with stories of displaced peoples;
        usually they are fleeing wars or famines or plagues or some monumental
        natural disasters. These stories usually have as their sub-plots, tales of woe,
        atrocities and human misery. They are also usually interspersed with tales of
        knavery and bravery. But perhaps none of them comes close, in their gruesomeness,
        to the gory tales literally oozing from the sores of the displaced people of
        Bakassi peninsula in Cross River State Nigeria who were, by the fiat of  a  verdict
        of the  International Court of  Justice  jurors sitting thousands of kilometers away
        from their shores, virtually passed off as cargo to be shipped to mainland Nigeria,
        while Cameroon was pronounced lords of their ancestral lands.
        Dislocation, desolation and death are only a few of the immediate collateral damages
        following hurried efforts to give effect to that judgment, via the  Green Tree Agreement
        in New York.. The judgment itself and the set of processes it set in motion stood logic
        on its head.
      </p>

      <p>
        But even before that judgment in  October 2002, the people of Bakassi peninsula had been
        the butt of gendarme jokes. From them  they had faced incessant harassment and attacks.
        Unable to bear the constant barrage of Kalashnikovs, they had started fleeing their land,
        first in trickles, then in large numbers. It was not only the original,  ancestral Bakassians
        that left; because of its favorable  location as a fishing settlement, the towns and
        island-villages that make up the peninsula had attracted numerous settlers from near and
        distant lands - Efiks, Ibibios, Igbos, Ijaws, Binis, Ewes, Yorubas and other ethnic groups
        from Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Togo and diverse other parts. Over time, these had inter-married
        with some of the Ancestral Bakassians and, in fact, some had no other place they could call home
        other than ABANA, ATABONG, ARCHIBONG and the various other settlements that constitute Bakassi.
        All these too, unable to cope with attacks on their lives and looting of their wares by the
        Cameroonian gendarmes,  fled, at various times in the late 1990's and the early years of the
        new millennium. But the real exodus, the real shame of a people leaving their ancestral and
        means-of-livelihood land in droves was occasioned by Nigeria's rush to implement the GREEN TREE
        Agreement that Nigeria was hoodwinked into signing with Cameroon at the instance of the then
        Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ghanaian born Kofi Anan in Green Tree, New York on 12 June 2006.
      </p>


      <p>
        But even the requirement in that agreement that the displaced people be properly resettled prior
        to handover was conveniently ignored as Nigeria's green-white-green flag was lowered before her
        bewildered citizens who had looked to her for protection.  It was their cue to run for their lives,
        for all the pronouncements and pledges at that most sobering ceremony  to protect the Nigerian
        population  now ran even more hollow, and run they did.  Many died in the process. All abandoned
        their means of livelihood and even whatever property/belongings had been spared by the gendarmes
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, they are dispersed mainly in Cross River and  Akwa Ibom States  where the official line
        is that they have been 'settled', but whoever understands the corruption-laden meaning of the word
        'settle' in Nigeria will equally understand that, indeed, some people must have really 'settled'
        themselves, at the expense of the returnee Bakassians, from the millions of dollars voted by federal
        and UN organs for the Bakassi resettlement project. From  Akwa Ibom and Cross River and Bayelsa,  many
        have found their way into neighboring states, and it is from here that chapters of misery really open
        to a yet uncaring, rather complicit world. But from what is stirring like an awakening tiger, Nigeria
        and indeed, the world may soon pay the prize of such  complicity.
